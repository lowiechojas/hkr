bootstrap assignment: HKR(Handler Kit Request)

This is my aasignment on one of my subject. This is a bootstrap template provided for us, and is tasked to modify it depending on our web design which can be used in our company.
Here, I have created a Handler Kit Request database which handles the request of handler kit for each product. The user can reques to borrow a specific kit and delete a request. While the admin of the database can approve, addkit, add user and delete user account.
